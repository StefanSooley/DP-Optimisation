This script completes both problems successfully.

It is currently configured for the problems given in the notes, but this can be changed to a more general problem.

The input network is given as: 

[[2, 1], [[2, 3], [3, 2]], [[2, 3], [6, 2], [4, 5]], [[3, 4], [5, 1], [2, 3], [3, 4]]]

where the numbers are the node weights upwards and downwards respectively. 
Note each list is 2d EXCEPT for the first list which is 1d (for the first node).

The capbud network is given similarly, as:

[[[2,3],[4,6],[7,10]],[[1,2],[3,5]],[[3,5],[5,7],[8,13]]] 

where each plan is an list of the cost and return respectively.
This is placed on the first line of inputcapbud.txt, and on the second line is the starting capital, as an integer.
